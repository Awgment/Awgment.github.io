                                <h3>Project Description</h3>
								<p>
                                    This webtext documents a location-based digital writing project exhibited at <a href="https://www.asle.org/conference/biennial-conference/archive/" target="_blank"> the 2017 Association for the Study of Literature and the Environment (ASLE) conference </a> held in Detroit, Michigan. This project was funded through a grant from the conference organizers, and it engages with the three core aims of ASLE’s subvention grant program by 1) producing a project “of a scholarly and/or creative nature that engage[s] with new media,” 2) fostering “intercultural or interdisciplinary exchange,” and 3) bringing “insights from the environmental humanities to a non-academic public” (ASLE). This webtext builds from the aims of the project to contribute to our broader goal of offering a generative model for how mobile technologies might be employed within writing studies scholarship and in public humanities contexts more broadly.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                    “Articulate Detroit,” the project presented at the conference, uses free mobile application software to generate augmented reality displays at eighteen locations along Detroit’s iconic Woodward Avenue. Augmented reality technologies (“AR” hereafter) overlay multimedia digital content onto a live-camera view of one’s physical surroundings. The digital content displayed within AR experiences can be anything from sound media to complex 3D animations; however, due to technical and production limitations, we restricted the digital content of our project to short two- to three-minute videos discussing the evolution of Detroit as a networked rhetorical space. Logistically, project participants traversed a two-mile stretch of Woodward Avenue from Wayne State University (the conference location) to the Detroit River, stopping periodically to access geo-tagged AR displays through their mobile devices. These AR displays coordinate archival video and photographic media of prominent moments in Detroit’s cultural and rhetorical history with the material spaces in which these events occurred. As such, these AR displays allow users to visualize the complex spatial networks that make up the city of Detroit. For this webtext, the complete AR content is available through a Google Map and videos are also included throughout.

                                <h3>Theoretical Rationale</h3>
								<p>
                                    This project emerges from Jeff Rice’s work in Digital Detroit: Rhetoric and Space in the Age of the Network. Here, Rice makes the case for reading cities (among other spaces) as a series of overlapping rhetorical networks comprised of public narratives, personal histories, and cultural materials. Unraveling the rhetorical underpinnings of a city like Detroit, Rice claims, requires a more emplaced, personal, and meandering methodology that challenges the totalizing “grand narratives” through which we might normally approach an iconic space. We claim that the mobile affordances of modern smartphone technologies offers a useful platform for enacting Rice’s theories of digital writing as a networked phenomenon. As such, our project aligns most with Rice’s imperative that understanding spatial rhetorics as networked requires recognizing that “the network...operates by movement, not fixity. That movement involves how we move within information and spaces simultaneously” (10). 
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                    Throughout his book, Rice employs chora—a concept popularized by Plato in the Timaeus to refer to the space inside the polis but outside the city proper—as a method over topos. While topos-based methods encourage us to see locations as isolated, choric methods insist that we step back and see the larger connections that emerge out of place as networks. Gregory Ulmer (1994) defines choragraphy as “a rhetoric of invention concerned with the history of ‘place’ in relation to memory” (p. 39), and a “method for writing and thinking electronically” (p. 45).  As Ulmer (2005) asserts in Electronic Monuments, “chora mediates individual/collective identities” (p. 26). Ultimately, the “Articulate Detroit” project seeks to catalyze new types of choric movement through Detroit beyond the rhetoric of decay and rebirth that have come to typify discussions of the city. To this end, the project illuminates Detroit’s complex identity as a site of competing histories, ideologies, and economic and cultural trajectories. In so doing, we hope to visualize how the city of “Detroit” (or any city for that matter) is not reducible to any kind of static, essential identity but rather emerges as the result of contingent relationships between and among human and non-human actors.

                                    Why Articulate?

                                </h3>
                                
                                <p>
                                    The “Articulate Detroit” project also emerges from efforts within the Trace Innovation Initiative, a collaborative digital humanities research endeavor within the University of Florida’s Department of English. Overall, the goal of Trace’s augmented reality project series is to “explore how writers use AR to modify and transform dominant narratives about objects, subjects, sites, and historical moments...by visualizing and reinventing the discursive boundaries surrounding these concepts” (Trace). As such, “Articulate Detroit”  connects with other AR projects from Trace that are testing the rhetorical constraints and affordances of emerging mobile writing technologies as a medium for (re)writing space. For instance, the Trace affiliated project “Augmented Velorutionaries” allows users to view digital “ghost bikes” at locations where a cyclist has been killed or seriously injured by a car within the city of Jacksonville, FL. These digital apparitions serve as haunting reminders of what Gregory Ulmer refers to as the “abject sacrifices” of car-centric urban planning. 
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                    This project also builds from the authors’ interests in the emerging relationship between technology and place-based composition practices. Composing with and alongside locations is a vital component of emplaced writing practices. In his article “From Augmentation to Articulation: (Hyper)linking the Locations of Public Writing,” Jacob Greene questions the rhetoric of “augmentation” that is prominent in contemporary discussions of mobile technologies. As an alternative, he proposes strategies of “articulation,” which he defines as a process of acknowledging the “distributed agential forces embedded within one’s environment.” Moreover, Madison Jones describes the value of bridging contemporary movements in location-based writing to work in ecocomposition to understand how ecologies of writing emerge from the relationships among writers and the material environment. Thinking of place as “choric premises [to] the very conditions of writing itself” further suggests how writers can compose with/in places as opposed to merely writing about a place. 
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                    By integrating digital counter-discourses within spaces where information is often tightly controlled and highly regulated (such iconic city streets or busy urban intersections), location-based AR projects work to re-articulate dominant narratives about a given space. As Woodward Avenue becomes a site impacted by gentrification, this project demonstrates how augmented reality can allow divergent histories to occupy sites of change. 
                                </p>

								<h3>What is Augmented Reality?</h3>
								<p>
									Augmented reality is an emerging technology that displays multimedia digital content 
									onto a live-camera view of one's physical surroundings. Unlike virtual reality, which 
									completely immerses the user, augmented reality allows the user to re-articulate and 
									interact with their environment. In the image below (bottom-left), augmented reality is used to 
									memorialize cyclist fatalities in the city of Jacksonville, FL.
